Soljar – A Decentralized Tipping & Funding Platform

Soljar is a Web3-native sponsorship and tipping platform built on Solana, allowing creators, developers, and anyone else to receive crypto donations seamlessly. The goal is to provide a simple and permissionless way for users to accept SOL, USDC, and other tokens without requiring sign-ups, intermediaries, or centralized control.

How It Works
	1.	Set Up Your Jar
	•	Users create a Jar (a personal treasury) that serves as their on-chain tipping account.
	•	Each Jar is tied to their wallet and acts as a place to receive and track donations.
	2.	Generate a “Sponsor Me” Button or Link
	•	Users can generate a custom button or link (e.g., soljar.xyz/yourname) to embed on their website, GitHub, or social media.
	•	Anyone clicking the button can send a tip instantly in SOL or USDC via a simple on-chain transaction.
	3.	Flexible Funding Options
	•	Direct Payments: Tips go straight to the recipient’s wallet.
	•	Treasury Mode: Funds are pooled in the Jar, allowing users to track sources (e.g., which website sent the tip) before claiming them later.
	4.	Transparent & Decentralized
	•	Every transaction happens on-chain, meaning no middlemen, no platform lock-ins.
	•	Built-in tracking allows users to see where their tips are coming from (e.g., which website link generated the tip).
	5.	For More Than Just Developers
	•	While starting with developers (similar to GitHub Sponsors), Soljar can be used by anyone—artists, writers, educators, or anyone seeking community support.
	•	Future features could include fundraising campaigns, community funding pools, and even NFT-based memberships.
